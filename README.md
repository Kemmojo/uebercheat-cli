# Commandline Kit for Uebersicht Cheatsheet widget
This is a simple collection of standard tools for the [Uebersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/ "Home of Uebersicht") cheatsheet [widget](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/#markdown_cheat_sheet "Markdown Preview Widget").

## Instruction
Ever found yourself trying to remember how this one particular system function was called, maybe because you are working on a complex project and the function is which makes your life easier and now you feed google with some weird searchterms, hoping you get the old result which brought the information.

Truth to be told, there are a lot of helpful tools and websites like Stackoverflow, which help you find the right tools for you needs.
But sometimes you just want to skip the process of searching and just look at a specific resource, see what you need, implement it in your code and rock on.
This is where Uebersichts Markdown-Preview Widget comes in handy. It shows you a non-interactional Panel on your Desktop like a background image, which monitors markdown files like README.md´s on Github.

Now this is great for reviewing purposes, but what makes it really amazing is that you can switch between multiple markdownfiles.

You may ask "So, why the commandline kit ?", well, in order to change the currently viewed file, you need the advice the widget to change it, by giving the variable which holds the file to be monitorized, the file name you want to be displayed in the panel.
There are two ways, either you do it manually in the code, or there is a workflow for the alfred application.
Now, if you like me and find yourself more often playing with the terminal of choice, a tool to handle your Markdown-Preview panel and your markdownfiles, wouldn't just speed up your programming process, it gives you a great way to learn coding quicker.

Now all blabla´s away, let´s dive in. :)
